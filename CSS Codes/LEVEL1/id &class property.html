       The story is set on a night sometime in August, in West Riding of Yorkshire, England, in the woods and moors near the (possibly fictional) March Abbey. The exact time period is unclear, but it is likely set at some point close to when the story was written in the late nineteenth century. The main character is a man named Weigall who is searching for his close friend, Wyatt Gifford, who’d gone missing two nights prior during an otherwise mundane hunting trip. Weigall knows Gifford as an “incorrigible practical joker,” and is almost convinced that the man’s disappearance is part of his latest prank.[1] Nonetheless, Weigall is concerned for Gifford, and ends up searching the forest for him after the rest of his hunting party retired for the night.
       <br>    While walking through the woods, Weigall recalls a philosophical conversation between himself and Gifford about the nature of souls and their connection to one’s physical body, particularly after death. Eventually, he comes upon a section of the River Wharfe known as the Strid. Seeing this particularly deadly stretch of water disquiets him, and he resolves to leave, until he sees a hand reaching out for help from the river.</br>
       <br>  As Weigall struggles to pull the person out of the Strid’s currents, he realizes that it is Gifford he is attempting to rescue, and pulls with renewed determination until the man comes free, floating downriver to a still pool. When Weigall wades in, hoping to retrieve and revive his friend, he instead discovers that his body no longer has a face.
